        I was born in the exuberant city ofJakarta, Indonesia.
        <br>I went to school there until university. I graduated in 2004.
        <br>After working for around 2.5 years, I moved to Singapore.
        <br>My family is in Indonesia.

        I moved to Singapore in 2007. I worked there for many years as a Software Engineer.
        Eventually I became a Singaporean citizen.
        <br>But in 2016, I made a dramatic change in my life, I quit my job and left Singapore.

        After 5 months in Jakarta, I flew to Toronto, Canada.
        <br>To start a new life, leave the IT industry behind, and work for a different industry.
        <br>At least, that's what I thought at the time.

        During my pregnancy, I decided to return to IT. And I wanted to become a Full-Stack Web Developer.
        <!-- <br>Initially I wanted to join a bootcamp in Toronto. But after learning how expensive it is, I turned to online courses. -->
        <br>I found some great courses on Udemy and started from there.
        <br>I finished my online bootcamp, completed my demo projects, and picked up some more skills from online sources.
